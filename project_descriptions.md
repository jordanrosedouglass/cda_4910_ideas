# Forecasting Florida Incarceration Trends
Team: Jordan Douglass and Oliver Bennett

The initial goal of the project between Oliver and I was to measure and reflect upon healthcare in the Florida Prison Systems; unfortunately, Florida does not require a lot of data reporting in terms of healthcare for inmates.

That being explained, we began correlating the incarceration data, recidivism rates and social determinants of health between the years 2012-2017 for all counties in the state of Florida. Some of the social determinants included have been graduation rates, median household income, race and children in poverty. In our data exploration, we found many correlations within counties for these determinants and have been creating forecasting models using linear regression to determine what the next five years may look like for these specific couties given this data and how rates may be impacted if the data changed. For example, a question we are asking is, will Polk County have lower incarceration rates if the graduation rate goes up?

Upon creation of the static regression models, we hope that we may be able to create a web application that can be more insightful and interactive for users.
